==Main Idea
- One-click cryptocurrency exchange.
- Access to unknown cryptocurrencies.
- Use of Poloniex or Kraken API.
- No user creation... let's think in something smart as fuck :-).
- Initally focused on latin America market, spanish language.


==Initial front end proposal workflow.
1) Select the pair exchange from 2 drop down list. (4 clicks)
2) Put the amount of coins to be exchanged. (1 click)
3) Automatically display an estimated of coins to be received and the estimated time.
4) Put the address to receive the coins (1 Click) 
5) Display the address where the user will send the coins, as well QR.
6) Inform the user when teilen received the coins
7) Inform the user when he received the coins. Sent an email? Sms? Display it in same page? Do not inform?


==Open topics:
•	Between the steps 6 and 7 we make the exchange in either Kraken, Poloniex or in future from our own altcoins and send the new coins to   the user subtracting our commission.
•	At least 6 clicks are required in previous steps, should be reduced somehow. Keep it as simple as possible.
•	Initially the earnings would be kept in the external exchange?
•	Which exchange account will be used? Create a teilen account?
•	Create an English version?
