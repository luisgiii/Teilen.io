Configuration steps in order to configure and
run an EC2 Instance in Amazon's AWS.

WARNING: I don't know if this is free.
Probably for an intensive use it will not be, so please consider that.

For new users:
  1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/
  2. Create an account (I'll assume that you have already one, sorry).
  3. Go to "My Account" and select "AWS Management Console".
  4. In the search box write EC2 and click Enter.
  5. Find the Launch Instance button and click it.
  6. It will take you to a list of the available machines for use.
  7. The next is basically merely configuration steps and is pretty straight
  forward. Piece of cake.
  8. Download the *.pem and then access to the machine via SSH.
  9. DO NOT FORGET TO STOP YOUR MACHINE.

If you already own an EC2 instance:
  1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com
  2. Go to "My Account" and select "AWS Management Console".
  3. In the search box write EC2 and click Enter.
  4. Check the Side bar and click where it says "Instance".
  5. Right-click the machine name and Start it.
  6. Access to it via SSH and make crypto money.
